Question Subject Line: CSC 275 Online Lab 10 Question
Your goal with this lab is to simulate the window below. The window has a JList (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/JList.html) and 2 buttons. The Add Course button should generate a pop-up using a JOptionPane and ask for another course name. When the user finishes entering the course name it should be added to the JList.


 

Please note: There is an error on some Macâ€™s that require you to resize your JFrame when the program is running for your buttons to show up.
